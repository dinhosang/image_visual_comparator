# Some things I'd like to try in this repo

- rust
- image comparison
- concurrency / parallelism if appropriate

If wishing to PR:

- ensure you've installed cargo-make:
  - cargo install cargo-make
  - run the install task
    - cargo make install

## Not intending to handle

- responding to there being mismatched images, caller of cli should see result file and decide what they want to do
- terminal interaction by user
  - should just take starting input and run
